
# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Classification 

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying brain tumors using MRI images. It categorizes MRI scans into four distinct classes:
- **Glioma**
- **Meningioma**
- **Pituitary**
- **No Tumor**

We utilize the **EfficientNetB1** model (pre-trained on ImageNet) and fine-tune it for this classification task. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains labeled MRI scans for training and testing.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes cropping MRI images to focus on the tumor area, resizing to a uniform size, and applying data augmentation techniques.
- **Model Architecture**: Utilizes `EfficientNetB1` as a feature extractor followed by custom layers for classification.
- **Training Enhancements**: 
  - Early Stopping
  - ReduceLROnPlateau for learning rate adjustment
  - Model Checkpointing to save the best model
- **Visualization**: Displays training/validation accuracy and loss graphs, confusion matrix, and classification reports for evaluation.
